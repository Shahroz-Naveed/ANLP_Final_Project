Some common medical questions may not be directly answerable if the specific information is not present in the indexed documents.\n","2.  **Recency of Information**: The evaluation data is historical. Medical guidelines and treatments evolve, so the system's knowledge is static to the dataset's creation time.\n","3.  **Specificity vs. Breadth**: While deep on specific clinical notes, the system might lack the broader, synthesized medical knowledge of a general-purpose medical AI.\n","4.  **Reliance on Embedding Quality**: The quality of retrieval heavily depends on the embedding model's ability to capture semantic similarity in the medical domain.\n","\n","## Recommendations for Future Improvements\n","1.  **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate more diverse and up-to-date medical literature (e.g., research papers, official guidelines) to broaden knowledge and ensure currency.\n","2.  **Advanced Retrieval**: Implement re-ranking mechanisms or more sophisticated retrieval algorithms (e.g., hybrid search, query expansion) to improve the precision and recall of retrieved contexts.\n","3.  **Confidence Scoring**: Develop a mechanism to assess the system's confidence in its answers, especially when the retrieved context is sparse or contradictory.\n","4.  **Specialty-Specific Models**: Explore fine-tuning embedding models or LLMs for specific medical specialties to enhance performance in those areas.\n","5.  **Multi-Hop Question Answering**: Improve the system's ability to answer questions that require synthesizing information from multiple, non-contiguous chunks or documents.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","The Medical RAG System successfully answers medical queries using retrieved context from clinical transcriptions, demonstrating core RAG principles with medical domain specialization. While it shows promising capabilities in grounding answers in provided data and handling limitations gracefully, further enhancements in data coverage and retrieval sophistication would significantly improve its utility and robustness.\n","\n","---\n","*Generated automatically by Medical RAG Evaluation System*\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Print the complete markdown report\n","print(report_content)\n","print(\"\\nFinal Task: Evaluation report generated and displayed successfully!\")\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b6b60a7d"},"source":["## Analyze Evaluation Data\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Thoroughly analyze the `evaluation_df` to extract specific metrics such as the exact number of queries with context, average answer length, and to identify diverse and representative example query-answer pairs along with their sources and relevant metadata for the report.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dcb078df"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","First, I will calculate the requested metrics from the `evaluation_df` to summarize the RAG system's performance, including total queries, queries with sources, average sources, average answer length, and queries successfully using context.

Some common medical questions may not be directly answerable if the specific information is not present in the indexed documents.\\n2.  **Recency of Information**: The evaluation data is historical. Medical guidelines and treatments evolve, so the system's knowledge is static to the dataset's creation time.\\n3.  **Specificity vs. Breadth**: While deep on specific clinical notes, the system might lack the broader, synthesized medical knowledge of a general-purpose medical AI.\\n4.  **Reliance on Embedding Quality**: The quality of retrieval heavily depends on the embedding model's ability to capture semantic similarity in the medical domain.\\n\\n## Recommendations for Future Improvements\\n1.  **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate more diverse and up-to-date medical literature (e.g., research papers, official guidelines) to broaden knowledge and ensure currency.\\n2.  **Advanced Retrieval**: Implement re-ranking mechanisms or more sophisticated retrieval algorithms (e.g., hybrid search, query expansion) to improve the precision and recall of retrieved contexts.\\n3.  **Confidence Scoring**: Develop a mechanism to assess the system's confidence in its answers, especially when the retrieved context is sparse or contradictory.\\n4.  **Specialty-Specific Models**: Explore fine-tuning embedding models or LLMs for specific medical specialties to enhance performance in those areas.\\n5.  **Multi-Hop Question Answering**: Improve the system's ability to answer questions that require synthesizing information from multiple, non-contiguous chunks or documents.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe Medical RAG System successfully answers medical queries using retrieved context from clinical transcriptions, demonstrating core RAG principles with medical domain specialization. While it shows promising capabilities in grounding answers in provided data and handling limitations gracefully, further enhancements in data coverage and retrieval sophistication would significantly improve its utility and robustness.\\n\\n---\\n*Generated automatically by Medical RAG Evaluation System*\\n\"\"\"\n","\n","# Print the complete markdown report\n","print(report_content)\n","print(\"\\nFinal Task: Evaluation report generated and displayed successfully!\")\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3617f736"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","The previous error was due to an invalid f-string format specifier when conditionally displaying the average similarity or 'N/A'.
